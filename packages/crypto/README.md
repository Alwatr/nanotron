# Crypto

A robust generator of secure authentication HOTP tokens, employing the HMAC-based One-Time Password algorithm, accompanied by a suite of cryptographic utilities, all encapsulated within a compact TypeScript module.

**This package includes:**

1. [AlwatrHashGenerator](./src/hash.ts): Secure **self-validate** hash generator.
2. [AlwatrTokenGenerator](./src/token.ts): Secure authentication HOTP token generator (HMAC-based One-Time Password algorithm).
3. [AlwatrUserGenerator](./src/user.ts): User factory for generating self-validate user-id and user-token.
4. [PreConfiguration](./src/pre-config.ts): Pre-configuration object for the hash/token generators.
